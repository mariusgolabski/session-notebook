# GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to store, manage, and share their code repositories. It provides tools for tracking changes, branching, merging code, and facilitating collaboration among team members. GitHub has become a central hub for open-source projects, enabling developers worldwide to contribute to and discover a vast array of software projects.

## Markdown

The Markdown syntax allows writing formatted text (headlines, blockquotes, lists, etc.) that can be
stored in plain text. It is used by tools and websites like GitHub or Slack. It uses specific
characters to format parts of the text in a certain way.
